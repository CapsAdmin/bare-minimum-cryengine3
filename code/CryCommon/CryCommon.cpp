// CryCommon.cpp 
//		This contains compiled code that is used by other projects in the solution.
//		Because we don't want static DLL dependencies, the CryCommon project is not compiled into a library.
//		Instead, this .cpp file is included in every project which needs it.
//		But we also include it in the CryCommon project (disabled in the build), 
//		so that CryCommon can have the same editable settings as other projects.

// Set this to 1 to get an output of some pre-defined compiler symbols.
