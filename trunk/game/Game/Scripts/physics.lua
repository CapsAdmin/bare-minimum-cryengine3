Log("registering explosion and shapes with physics system...");

local folder = "objects/prototype/breakable/";

-- RegisterExposionShape params, in this order:
-- 1) boolean shape cgf name
-- 2) characteristic "size" of the shape. ideally it should roughly represent the linear dimensions of the hole. 
--    whenever a carving happens, it requests a desired hole size (set in explosion params or surfacetype params), 
--		and the shape is scaled by [desired size/characteristic size]. if several shapes are registered with the same id, 
--    the one with the size closest to the requested will be selected, and if there are several shapes with this size, 
--    one of them will be selected randomly
-- 3) breakability index (0-based), used to identify the breakable material
-- 4) shape’s relative probability – when several shapes with the same size appear as candidates for carving, 
--    they are selected with these relative probabilities
-- 5) splinters cgf – used for trees to add splinters at the place where it broke
-- 6) splinters scale – splinters cgf is scaled by [break radius * splinters scale], 
--    i.e. splinters scale should be roughly [1 / most natural radius for the original cgf size]
-- 7) splinters particle fx name – is played when a splinters-based constraint breaks and splinters disappear
-- 
-- RegisterExposionCrack params, in this order:
-- 1) crack shape cgf name (must have 3 helpers that mark the corners, named "1","2","3")
-- 2) breakability index (same meaning as for the explosion shapes)
