--  Description      : Sample entity implemented as a Game Object Extension
--                     that shows how to get started with Animated Character
--                     from a code point of view.
--                     See also AnimatedCharacter.h/.cpp, as that's where
--                     most of the implementation for this entity is.

function AnimatedCharacterSample:OnPropertyChange()

	-- As most of this entity is written in C++, we just want to send a notification
	-- that a property has changed, and deal with it there.
